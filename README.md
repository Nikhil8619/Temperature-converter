This project is a step-by-step guide to creating a temperature converter website. This project utilizes the trifecta of web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Explaining HTML File: The core structure of our website is defined in the HTML file. We start by specifying the document type and essential metadata. The document is divided into sections: a title, viewport settings, and a reference to an external CSS file. The body of the document contains the website's content.
I have created a simple, user-friendly interface with three input fields. Users can input temperatures in either Celsius or Fahrenheit or Kelvin.Here You Can either give the input in any means and can get their respective conversions .
Explaining CSS File:The appearance and layout of the website are styled using CSS. We've chosen a clean and modern design for our website. The body has a light background color, and the content is centered in a container with rounded corners and a subtle drop shadow. The title is styled in a readable font, and the input fields, buttons, and result display areas are carefully designed for a pleasant user experience.
Explaining JS File:The functionality of the temperature converter is powered by JavaScript. Two conversion functions are defined. When users click either of the conversion buttons, these functions are executed. They take the input temperature, perform the conversion, and display the result with two decimal places to ensure precision.
